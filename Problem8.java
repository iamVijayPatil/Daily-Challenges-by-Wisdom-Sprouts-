Problem : Reverse a String Word by Word
You are given a string s that consists of multiple words separated by spaces. Your task is to reverse the order of the words in the string. Words are defined as sequences of non-space characters. The output string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, and multiple spaces between words should be reduced to a single space.

Input :
A string s of length n (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^4) consisting of letters, digits, punctuation, and spaces.
Input: "the sky is blue"

Output :
A string where the words in s are reversed, with a single space separating the words, and no leading or trailing spaces.
Output: "blue is sky the"
